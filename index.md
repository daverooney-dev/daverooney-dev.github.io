# Welcome!

I'm Dave Rooney, a software developer, Agile Coach, manager and Extreme Programming aficionado! I've been at this software thing since the early 1980s when I discovered that I loved solving problems for myself and other people on the trusty Apple ][ machines in my high school.

More than 40 years later, I still love to solve problems and help others to solve theirs!
